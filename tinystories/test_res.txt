It is not yours and you should not take it. If you take it, you will be punished and you will be in trouble."<0x0A>Lily did not listen. She took the shirt and put it in her bag. She said to the shirt, "I don't care who I am. I'm sure it is yours."<0x0A>But Lily's mum heard her and looked very worried. She said to Lily, "Lily, I know you are angry, but you are now ashamed. You should be sorry for taking the shirt. It is very important to your parents. They will punish you for what you did."<0x0A>Lily thought about it and decided her mum was right. She apologized to her mum and took the shirt back.<0x0A>From that day on, Lily learned her lesson.
