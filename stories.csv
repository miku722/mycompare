""It's a monster that can shrink,"" said the Shoggborn.
Lily thought for a moment and then said, ""I want to shrink too!"" 
Tom smiled and said, ""I have a brush. We can use it to shrink your skin.""
So Lily and Tom started using the brush to shrink her skin. When they touched it, it became so small that they could even scoop a pile of sand inside.
Lily was amazed and said, ""I wish I could shrink things like this too!""
Tom laughed and said, ""That would be so cool!""",174,1.279724

Lily was a bit confused, but she decided to try. She talked to the Shape there and the Shog gently told her its names. After that, Lily spoke some of the words and soon she was really good at it.
The Shape lantern was always happy when Lily talked to the Shape and the Shre centre. They taught her to be very careful with their words and also respected each other when they spoke.
The Shape lantern and Lily spent the whole day together. Lily realized that she had been kind and thoughtful, even though the Shapeen meant she had been a better friend. From that day on, Lily and the Shoglow had many new adventures together.",202,1.007759

Lily was amazed. She had never seen a number game before.
""What does it play?"" she asked.
""It's play game with counting stars and stars,"" the Shuna reappeared.
Lily was so excited. She watched as the Shog practiced counting stars and circles. 
After a few more times, Lily had a good idea. She wanted to find out why the numbers were counting 10 stars. 
So, Lily and her shy little shrimp searched the ground and eventually found a really big number- ability backwards. She clapped her hands and the Shog rubbed his other paws against her legs.

Lily smiled and was glad that the Shirt had a special place to keep numbers.",232,4.446034

""That won't work,"" said Lily. ""Why can't I keep it? It's too hard.""
Lily's mom smiled and said, ""Every time you take a look at the shade, it looks and smells nice. You need to take it out and replace it so it can go. It's not so good to look at it, you know.""
Lily thought about it for a few minutes, then she nodded. ""Okay,"" she said. ""I will take it out.""
Lily slowly took out the shade of the secret Shog pony and replaced it with a colourful new top. She was very happy and felt much better.
Later that day, Lily and her mom went to the shop and the shade sale was bought. When they got home, Lily quickly grabbed the top of the shade and set it on the table. It was the perfect fit for her special shirt.",254,1.268005
